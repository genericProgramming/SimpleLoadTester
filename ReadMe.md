TODO
* Figure out a better interface than the 'Start' methods 
scattered everywhere -- missing a simplification somewhere
* look @ a feeder style setup
* validate the engine is reaching the correct RPS 
(so that we don't keep adding reqs and then topple over)
* add temporary cap on number of requests emitted per second to avoid RPS issue
